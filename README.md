<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Aural Delicacy is an app that that aims to provide visually impaired diners with an enjoyable outdoor dining experience by providing restaurant menus that are accessible to the visually impaired. Visually impaired diners can make use of iPhone's VoiceOver functionality to intuitively browse through the menu items from different restaurants and add them to selection if they are interested in ordering the menu item. 

Our app uses crowd-sourcing to increase our collection of accessible menus available to our visually impaired users. Volunteers can snap a photo of a restaurant's menu and submit it together with the restaurant's information, to help us add the restaurant to our app and build a more inclusive dining experience for the visually impaired.
